## Late Policy
All projects are expected to be handed in by midnight of the due date. Feel free to make changes after critique or finish documentation. Students will be deducted 5% per day after that. If there is any reason why you can’t meet the deadline, notify the instructor via email or in class. The sooner you notify the instructor, the sooner they can help you find a solution or avoid late marks. If you need help accessing student services or resources, please reach out.


## Critique Policy:
See Critique Cheat Sheet on Moodle for additional information. Critiques are critical opportunities for artistic development and growth. Students are expected to be both supportive and constructively critical with each other. You are expected to engage actively in critique and be prepared to engage deeply with concept and technical aspects of projects

## Work outside class:
Students are expected to work 3-4 hours outside of class each week. If you don’t explore outside of class, you will not get better or comfortable with the electronics!

## Mandatory lab/class fees:
Students enrolled in IMCA 222 are required to pay a mandatory class fee of $40.00. Non- payment could result in an Incomplete. The deadline for fee payment is the Deadline for withdrawal with tuition refund (DNE) (see the Undergraduate Academic Calendar for date). Class fees unlock access to equipment, edit suites, and the production studio. Lab fees amounts are determined accordingly, to refurbishment costs for facilities, supplies, parts, and basic repair & maintenance necessary to operate during the semesters.

## Payment procedures:
Log into the Student Hub OR (https://adsys2.concordia.ca/OFAF/pages/
Default)

Select the course group or department.

Pick the Class fees from the drop-down list and add it to the cart.

When you have added all the fees you would like to pay, go to the cart and carefully review the contents. Make sure there are no duplicates (Quantity=2) or fees added by mistake.

Click “Pay Now” and fill in your credit card information. When the transaction is completed, you will receive a confirmation on screen and a copy of your invoice by email.

There is no lab fee to have access to the CDA (Center for Digital Arts) facilities, including the Hybrid Lab computers. Still, students must register for a CDA account. For CDA questions, see CDA counter on 5th floor of the EV building or https://

www.concordia.ca/finearts/cda.html

Students will be able to access most IMCA facilities (video editing suites, video production studio, project lab, electronic arts studios, etc) as well as some of the IMCA equipment. Prior booking through the IMCA portal or the IMCA technician will be necessary.  

## COVID Safety Policy:
Surgical masks are not mandatory, but recommended. If you are sick, do not attend class. Wash hands and sanitize frequently especially in shared lab spaces.

## Plagiarism:
The most common offence under the Academic Code of Conduct is plagiarism, which the Code defines as “the presentation of the work of another person as one’s own or without proper acknowledgement.” This includes material copied word for word from books, journals, Internet sites, professor’s course notes, etc. It refers to material that is paraphrased but closely resembles the original source. It also includes for example the work of a fellow student, an answer on a quiz, data for a lab report, a paper or assignment completed by another student. It might be a paper purchased from any source. Plagiarism does not refer to words alone –it can refer to copying images, graphs, tables and ideas. “Presentation” is not limited to written work. It includes oral presentations, computer assignments and artistic works. Finally, if you translate the work of another person into any other language and do not cite the source, this is also plagiarism.

In Simple Words: Do not copy, paraphrase or translate anything from anywhere without saying where you obtained it.

In a class like this, you will frequently use other people’s code and examples. This is totally fine, but you should indicate where you get it from AND change it meaningfully. Work that is a direct copy from a tutorial will not be accepted, even if it is cited. Work based on a tutorial should be indicated and linked.
