# Silly Sensor 15%
## Due week 5 October 2
Create a circuit that senses something: an interaction, a change, a situation, an event. The circuit can live on a body, a wall, a table, inside an object, hidden or visible. The circuit should in some way (light, movement, vibration, buzzer, heat) let the user know that something has happened. Use the techniques we discussed in class to create a refined object that can clearly sense something. 

Be creative, consider a complex or specific interaction in a particular scenario. No high five or hug sensors. 

Consider clever placement of your sensor inside/around obejcts/people/places to create an interaction. 

- A light sensor
- A bend or preassure sensor 
- Any DIY sensor
- A button or switch (DIY, traditional, magnetic, tilt, etc)
 
 Your piece should feel complete: ex no alligator clips or loose wiring. 

# Documentation should include a PDF with: 
● A description of the project.   
● A material & parts list.    
● Images of iteration and process. 
● A clear, strong image or images of the completed project.   
● A circuit diagram. 


# EVALUATION CRITERIA : 
Your circuits will be assessed basic on the following criteria:  
● Robustness.   
● Aesthetics.   
● Functionality.   
● Creativity and interaction.
