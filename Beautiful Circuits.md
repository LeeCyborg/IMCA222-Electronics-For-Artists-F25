# Beautiful Circuits 20%
## Due week 3 September 18
Create a functional circuit using nontraditional conductive materials (copper tape, conductive thread, aluminum foil, etc) where the circuit is incorporated into the aesthetic design of the object. You can use LEDs, motors or buzzers, but the circuit must be visible, with attention paid to the layout and craftsmanship. You should move through at least two (possibly more) iterations of this circuit. Be sure to carefully document your process and design choices, taking photos along the way. Bring the final prototype to class and post your project documentation to the class blog.
# Documentation should include a PDF with: 
● A description of the project. 
● A material & parts list.  
● Images of iteration and process
● A clear, strong image or images of the completed project. 
● A list of all materials you tried

# EVALUATION CRITERIA : 
Your wearable circuits will be assessed basic on the following criteria:
● Robustness. 
● Aesthetics. 
● Use of materials. 
● Creativity.
